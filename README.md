# Udacity Pixel Art Maker Project

## Built for Udacity Grow with Google Challenge

[Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me)

[Github Repo](https://github.com/udacity/project-pixel-art-maker-starter)

I added some automation to the build process with [Browser Sync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-sync)

To use as a starter simply:
1. Clone or Download this repo 
2. Navigate to the folder in the terminal or command line
3. Run npm init
4. To start the browswer-sync server up, type in npm start. Note if you want to use a different browser the package.json file will need to be modified. I point it to the Firefox Developer Edition, but this can certainly be changed.
